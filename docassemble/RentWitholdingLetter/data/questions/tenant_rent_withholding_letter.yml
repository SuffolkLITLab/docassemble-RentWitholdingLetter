  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Tenant Rent Withholding Letter
continue button field: Rent_Withholding_Letter_intro
question: |
  Tell your landlord that you are withholding rent
subquestion: |
  Everyone has the right to a safe home that is in good condition.
  
  If your landlord knows about a problem in your home and has not fixed it
  in a reasonable time, they may owe you money.
  
  Sometimes a tenant decides to **withhold**, or refuse to pay, rent until
  the landlord fixes the problem.
  
  This website will help you write a letter to your landlord explaining that
  you plan to withhold your rent.

id: should I withhold rent
question: |
  Should I withhold rent?
subquestion: |
  Withholding rent can be a good way to get your landlord's attention but
  it can also have risks.
  
  Below are some factors that may make withholding rent a good idea or a bad
  idea for your situation.
  
  Look over the list below carefully and answer as well as you can.
fields:
  - I have given my landlord a {reasonable} amount of time to fix the problem: withhold_suggested_reasonable_time
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - A housing inspector has told my landlord to fix the problem: withhold_suggested_inspector
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - My landlord did not fix the problem within the time that the housing inspector told my landlord to fix it: withhold_suggested_inspector_time_expired
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can work together with other tenants in my building: withhold_suggested_other_tenants
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can work with a {tenant organizing union}: withhold_suggested_organize
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can talk to a lawyer: withhold_suggested_lawyer
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can put the money into a separate bank account: withhold_suggested_escrow_possible
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I am able to risk my landlord filing an eviction case against me: withhold_suggested_eviction_risk
    datatype: yesnoradio    
terms:
  reasonable: |
    How much time is reasonable to fix a problem depends on how serious the 
    problem is. An emergency problem, such as no heat in the winter, should be 
    fixed within a day. A less serious problem could be fixed in 5 to 30 days.
  tenant organizing union: |
    A tenant's union, like City Life/Vida Urbana, or Lynn Tenants United, 
    may be a good resource to help you stand up to your landlord. Not all
    tenants have a local tenant's union.

question: |
  Rent withholding may not be the right choice for you.
subquestion: |
  The [law about withholding rent](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A) says that you must:
  
  * Have a serious housing problem
  * Your landlord needs to know about the problem  
  * You must not have been behind in rent at the time that your landlord learned about the problem
  * The problem cannot be caused by you or someone under your control, like a guest or your child
  * The problem must be fixable without you moving out permanently
  
  You still have the right to a safe home. [Learn more about other
