  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Tenant Rent Withholding Letter
continue button field: Rent_Withholding_Letter_intro
question: |
  Tell your landlord that you are withholding rent
subquestion: |
  Everyone has the right to a safe home that is in good condition.
  
  If your landlord knows about a problem in your home and has not fixed it
  in a reasonable time, they may owe you money.
  
  Sometimes a tenant decides to **withhold**, or refuse to pay, rent until
  the landlord fixes the problem.
  
  This website will help you write a letter to your landlord explaining that
  you plan to withhold your rent.

id: protecting self with rent withholding
question: |
  Protecting yourself when you withhold rent
subquestion: |
  #### There are many ways to get repairs made
  
  Before you withhold rent, you should understand if it is the right choice
  for you. Here are some other options that may make sense for some tenants:
  
  * Write your landlord a letter.
  * Ask a city housing inspector to document the problem.
  * Ask a judge to order your landlord to fix a problem.
  * Make the repairs yourself and deduct the cost from your rent.
  
  [Learn about your options](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-8-landlord-refusing-repairs)
  
  #### How long is too long to fix a problem?
  
  Depending on how serious the problem you reported is, your landlord may
  need to fix it within 24 hours, 5 days, or 30 days from when they learned
  about the problem.
  
  An example of a 24 hour problem:
  
  * No heat in the winter.
  * No working toilet.
  
  An example of a 5 day problem:
  
  * No sink or shower.
  * A rodent or insect infestation.
  
  An example of a 30 day problem:
  
  * Not enough hot water.
  * Loose or missing tiles or holes in walls, ceilings, or floors.
  
  [Housing code checklist](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-2-housing-code-checklist.pdf)

  #### Stronger together
  
  Withholding rent is a **tactic** to pressure your landlord to fix your 
  housing problem. You can be stronger if you work together: with other
  tenants in your building, with a city-wide tenant's union, a tenant
  organizer or your local legal aid provider.
  
  * [Organize your neighbors](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-pullout-10-getting-organized)
  * Tenants in Greater Boston may call [City Life/Vida Urbana](https://www.clvu.org/) ${ tel("(617) 524-3541") }
  * [Find an attorney](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/housing)
  
  #### Keeping your money safe
  
  It is important to know that while you have the right to withhold rent,
  it does not mean that you will get to keep it all if your landlord
  fixes the problem. A judge may decide that your landlord will get some
  or all of the money back.
  
  The amount that you can keep depends on how much a judge decides that your
  apartment is worth with the problems.
  
  One way to keep your money safe and to help show the judge that you are
  serious is to put the money in an **escrow** account.
  
  You can open an escrow account at any bank.
  
  #### What happens if your landlord tries to evict you?
  
  One risk of withholding rent is that your landlord will try to evict you.
  
  Only a judge can evict you from your apartment. Your landlord may file
  eviction paperwork with the court. Some important facts to know about
  eviction:
  
  * An eviction case is a public filing. It may appear on your credit report
    if you lose, and future landlords may learn that your landlord tried to 
    evict you.
  * It takes time to schedule an eviction case.
  * It costs your landlord money to file an eviction case. They need to pay to
    file the case. They may also need to pay a lawyer.

question: |
  Should I withhold rent?
subquestion: |
  Withholding rent can be a good way to get your landlord's attention but
  it can also have risks.
  
  Below are some factors that may make withholding rent a good idea or a bad
  idea for your situation.
  
  Look over the list below carefully and answer as well as you can.
fields:
  - My landlord refuses to fix the problem, or they are taking too long to fix it: withhold_suggested_landlord_refusing

  - I have given my landlord a {reasonable} amount of time to fix the problem: withhold_suggested_reasonable_time

  - A housing inspector has told my landlord to fix the problem: withhold_suggested_inspector
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - My landlord did not fix the problem within the time that the housing inspector told my landlord to fix it: withhold_suggested_inspector_time_expired
    datatype: yesnoradio
    show if: withhold_suggested_inspector
  - I can work together with other tenants in my building: withhold_suggested_other_tenants
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can work with a {tenant organizing union}: withhold_suggested_organize
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can talk to a lawyer: withhold_suggested_lawyer
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I can put the money into a separate bank account: withhold_suggested_escrow_possible
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - I am able to risk my landlord filing an eviction case against me: withhold_suggested_eviction_risk
    datatype: yesnoradio    
terms:
  reasonable: |
    How much time is reasonable to fix a problem depends on how serious the 
    problem is. An emergency problem, such as no heat in the winter, should be 
    fixed within a day. A less serious problem could be fixed in 5 to 30 days.
  tenant organizing union: |
    A tenant's union, like City Life/Vida Urbana, or Lynn Tenants United, 
    may be a good resource to help you stand up to your landlord. Not all
    tenants have a local tenant's union.

id: kickout withholding not right choice

question: |
  Rent withholding may not be the right choice for you.
subquestion: |
  The [law about withholding rent](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A) says that you must:
  
  * Have a serious housing problem
  * Your landlord needs to know about the problem  
  * You must not have been behind in rent at the time that your landlord learned about the problem
  * The problem cannot be caused by you or someone under your control, like a guest or your child
  * The problem must be fixable without you moving out permanently
  
  You still have the right to a safe home. [Learn more about other
